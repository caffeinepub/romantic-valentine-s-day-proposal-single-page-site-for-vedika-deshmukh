  "summary": "Most layout changes are implemented: a new hero video section is added before OpeningSection, the background photo section text is updated, and the “Our Moments Together 💖” section is replaced with exactly two clickable cards that navigate to a separate gallery screen. However, the new gallery page does not meet the “ONLY 4–5 photos / no extra content” and “render only existing assets (no broken slots)” requirements based on the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Gallery page/screen displays ONLY 4–5 uploaded photos (no extra content) and renders only real uploaded photo assets without placeholders; if fewer than 4 photos exist, render only the available photos.",
      "reason": "GalleryPage renders additional non-photo content (title, subtitle, bottom message, footer) and hardcodes 5 photo paths without any existence check/fallback; this can render broken images if some assets are missing, violating the ‘only available uploaded photos’ / ‘no placeholders’ behavior.",

      "requirement": "Enforce clean media rendering: do not auto-generate any additional image/video placeholders anywhere; missing assets should result in rendering nothing or only valid media.",
      "reason": "GalleryPage always maps over a fixed list of 5 image paths with no verification that the files exist; if any are missing, the UI will still render <img> elements for them (effectively creating empty/broken media tiles).",
